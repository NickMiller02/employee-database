## Description
This project was assigned to me to show off MySQL skills by creating back end databases to track
employees, departments, managers, and more. By using MySQL, the application is able to use inquirer
and add data into MySQL databases.

## Installation
Download the code through github and open through command terminal or VS Code.

The next step is to have MySQL downloaded and make sure your local storage has
the required dependencies inside your package.json file

To do so, run ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` to download all packages.

Next step is to run ```mysql -u root -p``` and enter your password.
Create your database by running ```SOURCE db/schema.sql;```


## Usage
Once the installation is complete, inside the MySQL Shell, repeat the command ```SOURCE db/schema.sql;```

After that, input the command ```quit;``` inside the MySQL shell

Once on the command line, input ```npm start``` or ```node server.js```


For mock data, go into the MySQL Shell and source the schema file, then enter ```SOURCE seeds.sql;```
